# Supervised-Machine-Learning-Task-Project-Loan_Tap_Company
Supervised-Machine-Learning-Task: Predict if an individual defaults or not, and if so what influences his/her default. Utility of the project: it would be useful  for the Company Loan_tap to understand a priori whether a person will more likely or not to pay  his debt.

Loan Tap is an online platform committed to delivering customized loan products to millennials.
They innovate in an otherwise dull loan segment, to deliver instant, flexible loans on consumer
friendly terms to salaried professionals and businessmen. The dataset contains nearly 400.000
observations each one for a single loan’s borrower.

# Objective
Our goal is to find the value of Loan_Status by processing the other variables. Loan_Status can
take on 2 values: “fully paid” or “charged off”. A debt is canceled (“charged off”) when it cannot
be repaid and is written into the losses of the balance sheet. At a utility level, it would be useful
for the company Loan_tap to understand a priori whether a person will more likely or not to pay
his debt.
